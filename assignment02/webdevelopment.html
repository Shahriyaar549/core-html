    <h1>Web Development</h1> <hr>
    <p>Web development is the process of building websites and web applications. It involves a combination of three primary technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used for styling the appearance of web pages. And JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is used for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
    Web development also involves the use of various tools and frameworks for building complex websites and web applications. Some of the popular tools and frameworks include jQuery, AngularJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, and many others. 
    The development process usually involves several stages, including planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. Developers often follow specific methodologies to ensure the project is structured and goal-oriented.
    In order to become proficient in web development, one needs to have a deep knowledge of these technologies, strong problem-solving skills, and a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures.</p>
